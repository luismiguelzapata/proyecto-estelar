Si las primeras generaciones no son perfectas:

### Problema: Colores incorrectos
**Solución**: Duplica la mención del color HEX en el prompt
```

```

### Problema: Aparecen accesorios no deseados
**Solución**: Añade al final del prompt
```
"CRITICAL: Absolutely no collars, bandanas, bows, ribbons, hats, clothes, or accessories of any kind. Completely bare character with only natural fur."
```

### Problema: Manchitas adicionales

```

### Problema: Ojos del tamaño incorrecto
**Solución**: Añade referencia comparativa
```
"Eyes must be oversized, each eye width should be 40% of total face width, significantly larger than realistic dog proportions, approaching anime-size but in 3D style"
```

### Problema: Proporciones adultas (patas largas)
