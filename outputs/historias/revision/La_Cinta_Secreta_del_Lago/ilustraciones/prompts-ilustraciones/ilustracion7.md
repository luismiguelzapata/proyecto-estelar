ENVIRONMENT:
The scene is set on the tranquil bank of a gently flowing river, under the warm glow of a late afternoon sun. The sky is a serene gradient of soft oranges and pinks, suggesting the approach of sunset, with a few fluffy clouds tinged with golden hues (#FFD700). The riverbank is lush with verdant grass (#7CFC00) and dotted with wildflowers in shades of lavender (#D8BFD8) and buttercup yellow (#FFD700), creating a vibrant carpet that invites the characters to explore. The water reflects the sky's palette, shimmering with ripples of #FF7F50 and #FFE4B5, creating an inviting path downstream.

In the foreground, Kira and Toby are near a small, makeshift raft made from branches and large green leaves (#2E8B57), their textures a mix of rough wood and smooth, waxy surfaces. The raft is carefully constructed, tied together with vines that add an earthy, natural touch. In the midground, the river lazily curves, leading the eye towards a distant horizon where the sun dips lower. The background is filled with towering trees, their leaves casting intricate shadows on the ground as the light filters through, adding depth and a sense of enclosure.

Around the scene, small decorative elements like fallen leaves and pebbles add to the sense of a natural, untouched environment, enhancing the adventurous atmosphere of the story.

CHARACTERS PRESENT:
Kira stands proudly on the raft, her expression determined and hopeful, ears perked and tail wagging slightly. Toby is beside her, sitting with a pensive look, one paw resting on the edge of the raft, eyes scanning the horizon.

LIGHTING & MOOD:
The lighting is warm and soft, with the sun casting long, gentle shadows across the scene. The color temperature is cozy and inviting, reinforcing a mood of adventure and camaraderie. The shadows are soft, creating a sense of calm and tranquility.

COMPOSITION & STYLE:
The illustration is composed using the rule of thirds, with Kira and Toby placed off-center to the left, drawing attention to the raft and the river's flow. The scene has a deep sense of depth, with layers of foreground, midground, and background elements. The style is a 3D CGI storybook in Pixar quality, with a palette of warm oranges (#FFA07A), greens (#32CD32), and blues (#87CEEB) that harmonize the scene.

CONTINUITY NOTES (for next illustration):
Maintain the position of the raft on the river and the direction of the flow. Keep the warm late afternoon lighting consistent. Toby should hold the mirror in the next scene.
