ENVIRONMENT:
The scene unfolds at the edge of a tranquil lake during the early morning. The sky is a serene gradient of orange and pink hues, casting a warm glow over the landscape. The gentle rustling of colorful wildflowers, mostly in shades of lavender and soft yellow, frames the scene. The water of the lake is calm, reflecting the vibrant colors of the sky and the surrounding nature.

CHARACTERS PRESENT:
- Kira (curious and alert)
- Toby (thoughtful and observant)

ACTION & MOVEMENT:
Kira stands near the water's edge, her eyes catching a glint of white as she spots a floating ribbon. Her ears perk up, and she leans forward, tail wagging slightly, as she reaches out with a paw to pick up the ribbon. Toby stands slightly behind Kira, his eyes following her movements with interest. As Kira picks up the ribbon, she reads the inscription aloud, her expression shifting to one of intrigue and excitement.

CAMERA:
Start with a medium shot of Kira and Toby at the lake's edge, highlighting their expressions and Kira's action of picking up the ribbon. Slowly zoom in to a close-up of the ribbon in Kira's paw, clearly displaying the inscription "Sigue la pista." The camera then pans up to Kira's face to capture her excited reaction.

LIGHTING & MOOD:
The lighting is soft and warm, enhancing the serene and slightly mysterious atmosphere of the scene. The sun's low position in the sky creates gentle reflections on the water, adding to the tranquil yet curious mood.

TECHNICAL:
3D CGI animation, Pixar/Disney quality, soft studio lighting, vibrant colors, 8K render, duration estimated at 5-8 seconds.

CONTINUITY NOTES (for next scene):
- Kira should hold the ribbon in her mouth as she turns to lead Toby.
- Toby should remain observant, positioned slightly behind Kira.
- The lake and wildflowers should continue to provide the scenic backdrop.
- Maintain the same warm lighting and late afternoon setting.
