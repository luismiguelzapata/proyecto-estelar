CHARACTERS PRESENT:
Kira (holding the ribbon, curious), Toby (focused on the mirror, attentive), Zippy the Zorrillo Chef (worried expression, standing outside the mirror)

ACTION & MOVEMENT:
Zippy, the zorrillo chef, is standing on the forest floor near Kira and Toby, looking up at them with a concerned expression. He timidly says, "I need help," gesturing towards the lake in the background. Kira and Toby turn their attention from the mirror to Zippy, their expressions shifting to concern and determination.

CAMERA:
Begin with a medium shot capturing Kira and Toby's reaction to Zippy's plea. Then, smoothly pan to include Zippy in the frame, highlighting his worried demeanor. The camera gently zooms in on Zippy as he gestures to the lake.

LIGHTING & MOOD:
The lighting is soft and magical, with beams of light filtering through the canopy, creating a serene and slightly mysterious atmosphere. The mood is a mix of empathy and resolve as the characters prepare to help Zippy.

CONTINUITY NOTES (for next scene):
- Maintain the positioning of Kira and Toby near Zippy.
