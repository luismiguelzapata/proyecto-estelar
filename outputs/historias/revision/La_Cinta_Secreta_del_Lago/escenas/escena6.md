ENVIRONMENT:
A mystical forest during the day, transitioning from the previous lakeside setting, with soft, gentle hail falling from the sky. The forest is lush with vibrant green leaves (#228B22) and a canopy that filters scattered light. The ground is covered with a mix of moss and fallen leaves in shades of brown and ochre. A large, sturdy oak tree stands prominently, its branches offering shelter.

CHARACTERS PRESENT:
- Kira: Curious and eager, with a sense of adventure in her eyes.
- Toby: Cautious but intrigued, displaying a mix of excitement and wariness.

ACTION & MOVEMENT:
Kira and Toby, initially standing near each other, react to the soft hail starting to fall by looking up at the sky. Kira nudges Toby with a playful glance, then both sprint towards the large oak tree. They pause beneath its branches, shaking off small bits of hail from their fur. Kira looks at Toby with determination and suggests, “Let’s find the secret!”

CAMERA:
Start with a wide shot capturing the forest and the falling hail, then smoothly pan to a medium shot focusing on Kira and Toby. As they run, switch to a dynamic tracking shot following their movement towards the tree. Conclude with a close-up of Kira’s face as she speaks.

LIGHTING & MOOD:
Soft studio lighting with a cool, diffused effect to mimic the overcast sky. The mood is one of playful urgency mixed with a touch of mystery, as the hail introduces a new twist to their adventure.

TECHNICAL:
3D CGI animation, Pixar/Disney quality, soft studio lighting, vibrant colors, 8K render. Duration estimated at 5-8 seconds.

CONTINUITY NOTES (for next scene):
- Kira and Toby remain under the oak tree.
- Hail should be visibly present on the ground.
- The ribbon in Kira’s possession should still be visible.
- Transition to the idea of building a raft with nearby branches and leaves.
