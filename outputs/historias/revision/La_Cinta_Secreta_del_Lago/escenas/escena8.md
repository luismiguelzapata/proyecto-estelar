ENVIRONMENT:
The scene is set beside a calm, reflective pond surrounded by lush greenery. It is midday, with a clear blue sky and no clouds. The dominant color palette consists of vibrant greens and blues, with dappled sunlight filtering through the leaves, casting playful shadows on the ground.

CHARACTERS PRESENT:
- Toby (curious and thoughtful)
- Kira (attentive and eager)

ACTION & MOVEMENT:
Toby holds a small, ornate mirror in his paw, tilting it gently to reflect sunlight onto the pond's surface. As the light dances across the water, Kira eagerly watches the reflections. As the light dances across the water, they notice the glint of something unusual—a bottle floating on the pond, hinting at their next step. Toby points excitedly, and Kira nods in agreement, wagging her tail.

CAMERA:
Begin with a medium shot focusing on Toby and Kira, capturing their expressions and movements. Zoom in slightly to a close-up of the mirror, reflecting light onto the pond. Track the movement of the light until it highlights the floating bottle, then shift to a medium shot of both dogs reacting.

LIGHTING & MOOD:
Use soft studio lighting to enhance the midday sun effect, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The mood is one of discovery and excitement, with gentle highlights on the characters' fur to emphasize their emotions.

TECHNICAL:
3D CGI animation, Pixar/Disney quality, soft studio lighting, vibrant colors, 8K render. Estimated duration: 5-8 seconds.

CONTINUITY NOTES (for next scene):
- Keep the bottle visible in the pond, ready for retrieval.
- Ensure Toby still holds the mirror.
- Maintain the partially completed raft in the background.
- The ribbon should still be visible with Kira.
- The mood of excitement should carry into the next scene as Zippy reacts to the discovery.
