ENVIRONMENT:
A serene riverside at midday, with a gentle breeze rustling the leaves. The ground is covered in small hailstones, remnants of a recent storm. The scene is colorful and vibrant, dominated by earthy tones of brown and green from the oak tree and the surrounding flora. A few scattered branches and leaves are visible nearby, perfect for constructing a makeshift raft.

CHARACTERS PRESENT:
KIRA (enthusiastic, determined)
TOBY (helpful, focused)

ACTION & MOVEMENT:
Kira and Toby are busily collecting branches and leaves by the riverside, assembling them into a small raft to aid in their quest to retrieve the lost recipe. Kira, with her heart-shaped spot on her right cheek, is energetically arranging the branches, while Toby uses his paws to stack the leaves meticulously. Their teamwork is evident as they communicate silently through nods and gestures. The ribbon Kira holds flutters gently in the breeze.

CAMERA:
Medium shot capturing both Kira and Toby in the foreground, focusing on their expressions and actions. The camera pans slightly to follow their movements as they build the raft.

LIGHTING & MOOD:
Soft, natural studio lighting enhances the vibrancy of the scene, creating a warm and hopeful atmosphere. The sunlight filters through the oak tree leaves, casting playful shadows on the ground.

TECHNICAL:
3D CGI animation, Pixar/Disney quality, soft studio lighting, vibrant colors, 8K render. Duration: 5-8 seconds.

CONTINUITY NOTES (for next scene):
- The raft should be partially completed and visible in the background.
- The ribbon in Kira’s possession should still be visible.
- Maintain the presence of hail on the ground.
- Transition to Toby holding a mirror, setting up the search for the floating bottle.
