ENVIRONMENT:
A snowy mountain landscape during a sunny morning, with patches of snow reflecting the sunlight. The surroundings are pristine and crisp, dominated by shades of white and light blue (#E8F1FA). The violet cup partially buried in the snow contrasts sharply against the white (#8A2BE2).

CHARACTERS PRESENT:
- KIRA: Excited and curious, with ears perked up.
- TOBY: Intrigued, with nose close to the ground, slightly wagging tail.

ACTION & MOVEMENT:
Kira and Toby are standing close to each other near a slightly buried violet cup. Toby sniffs the air around the cup, then looks up at Kira with a curious expression. Kira nods in agreement, her heart-shaped spot on her cheek visible, suggesting a shared decision to investigate further.

CAMERA:
A medium close-up shot captures both Kira and Toby from the side, slightly angled downwards to focus on the cup in the snow. The camera gently pans down to the cup as Toby sniffs around it.

LIGHTING & MOOD:
The scene is illuminated by soft studio lighting, simulating a bright sunny morning. The mood is one of curiosity and anticipation, with the sunlight casting soft shadows on the snow and highlighting the vibrant colors of the characters.

TECHNICAL:
Rendered in 3D CGI animation, Pixar/Disney quality, with soft studio lighting and vibrant colors. The scene is in 8K resolution with an estimated duration of 5-8 seconds.

CONTINUITY NOTES (for next scene):
- Maintain the snowy mountain landscape with consistent lighting and time of day.
- Kira and Toby should appear at the beginning of the next scene in a similar position but moving away from the discovery point.
- Toby's tail should continue wagging as they begin to move.
- The violet cup should remain in the snow, visible in the background as they move away.
