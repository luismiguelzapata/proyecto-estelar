CHARACTERS PRESENT:
Kira, Toby, and the axolotl médico, who appears concerned.

ACTION & MOVEMENT:
Kira and Toby approach the axolotl médico, who stands near the base of the rainbow bridge. The axolotl médico looks worried, glancing around anxiously. He asks, "¿Han visto una señal?", conveying his concern with a slight frown. Toby, standing attentively beside Kira, responds with a reassuring nod and says, "Tal vez podamos ayudar. ¿Dónde la viste por última vez?"

CAMERA:
Start with a wide shot capturing Kira and Toby arriving at the far end of the rainbow bridge. Gradually zoom in to a medium shot focusing on the interaction between the three characters, centering the axolotl médico as he speaks.

LIGHTING & MOOD:
Soft studio lighting enhances the gentle pastel colors of Kira's and Toby's fur, while the axolotl médico's pink hues are highlighted against the snowy backdrop. The mood is a mix of concern and hope, conveyed through gentle lighting and the characters' expressions.
