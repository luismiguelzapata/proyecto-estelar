ENVIRONMENT:
A serene winter forest setting, covered in a blanket of pristine snow. The sun is shining brightly in a clear blue sky, casting a warm glow over the landscape. The tall tree with lush branches and leaves is a prominent feature in the background. The snow on the ground has a soft, powdery texture with a cool palette of whites and light blues (#E0F7FA).

CHARACTERS PRESENT:
- TOBY: Excited and intrigued, standing near the base of the tree, eyes focused on the ground.
- KIRA: Curious, positioned on a high branch of the tree, looking down at Toby.
- AXOLOTL MÉDICO: Observant and attentive, standing near the base of the tree.

ACTION & MOVEMENT:
Toby, with an eager expression, lowers his gaze to the ground, noticing a set of rabbit tracks in the snow. He calls out to Kira, "Espera... mira esto..." as he points to the tracks. The camera follows Toby's paw, revealing the distinct rabbit footprints that lead to a displaced sign. Kira nods in understanding, and together with Toby, they work to reposition the sign correctly.

CAMERA:
Start with a medium shot focusing on Toby as he discovers the tracks, then smoothly pan down to reveal the rabbit footprints in the snow. Transition to a wider angle capturing both Toby and Kira as they collaborate to fix the sign.

LIGHTING & MOOD:
Soft studio lighting enhances the vibrant, playful atmosphere of the scene. The sunlight creates a warm, cheerful mood, casting gentle shadows that accentuate the details in the snow and on the characters.

TECHNICAL:
3D CGI animation, Pixar/Disney quality, soft studio lighting, vibrant colors, 8K render, estimated duration 5-8 seconds.

CONTINUITY NOTES (for next scene):
- Position the axolotl médico still standing near the base of the tree, looking at Kira and Toby.
- Kira should now be back on the ground next to Toby after fixing the sign.
- Maintain the rabbit tracks in the snow as a visual link.
- Continue the winter forest setting with the tall tree in the background.
- Ensure the clear blue sky and snowy landscape remain consistent.
