ENVIRONMENT:
A serene, snowy forest setting during late afternoon. The snow on the ground and on the trees is a pristine white, subtly reflecting the warm hues of the setting sun. The snow-capped mountain in the background appears majestic and slightly glows with an orange-pink tint. Dominant colors include soft whites, blues, and sunset oranges.

CHARACTERS PRESENT:
Kira (content, joyful), Toby (grateful, content), Axolotl Médico (waving, happy)

ACTION & MOVEMENT:
Kira and Toby walk side by side, slowly moving away from the axolotl, leaving impressions in the snow. They occasionally glance back at the axolotl, who remains near the base of the tree, waving a small, energetic goodbye with one of its hands. The mountain becomes more prominent as they walk towards it, symbolizing the journey home.

CAMERA:
A wide shot captures the entire scene, starting at a low angle to emphasize the vastness of the snowy landscape and the prominence of the mountain. The camera slowly pans upwards as Kira and Toby move forward, highlighting their path and the beautiful, glowing mountain.

LIGHTING & MOOD:
Soft studio lighting captures the warmth of the setting sun, casting a gentle, golden hue over the scene. The mood is one of fulfillment and warmth, illustrating the bond of friendship and accomplishment. The sunlight creates subtle highlights and shadows, enhancing the vibrancy of the scene.

TECHNICAL:
3D CGI animation, Pixar/Disney quality, soft studio lighting, vibrant colors, 8K render, duration estimated at 5-8 seconds.

CONTINUITY NOTES (for next scene):
- Position Kira and Toby close to the edge of the forest, with the mountain still visible in the background.
- Maintain the warm, late-afternoon lighting and the snow-covered environment.
- Ensure Kira and Toby's tracks in the snow remain visible, showing their path.
- Keep the axolotl out of the frame as Kira and Toby have moved on.
