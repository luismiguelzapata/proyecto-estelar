ENVIRONMENT:
The scene is set in a snowy landscape under a clear blue sky. The ground is covered in a pristine layer of snow, with the tall tree standing majestically. The tree is towering, with branches reaching upwards and a subtle sheen from the snowflakes on them. The color palette is dominated by whites, soft blues, and the earthy browns of the tree bark.

CHARACTERS PRESENT:
- Kira: Determined, climbing the tree.
- Axolotl médico: Pointing, watching Kira.

ACTION & MOVEMENT:
The axolotl médico points towards the tall tree with a gentle nod. Kira, with a look of determination in her eyes, begins to climb the tree. Her movements are agile as she ascends, her fur catching the sunlight. Once she reaches a high branch, she peers through the leaves and spots something shimmering. Her expression shifts to excitement as she shouts, "¡La encontré!"

CAMERA:
Start with a medium shot of the axolotl médico pointing, then pan to follow Kira as she climbs. Transition to a close-up of Kira's face as she spots the shiny object, capturing her expression of excitement.

LIGHTING & MOOD:
The lighting is soft with a warm glow, reflecting the pristine and hopeful atmosphere. The sunlight filters through the branches, creating a pattern of light and shadow on Kira's fur. The mood is adventurous and optimistic.

TECHNICAL:
3D CGI animation, Pixar/Disney quality, soft studio lighting, vibrant colors, 8K render, duration 5-8 seconds.

CONTINUITY NOTES (for next scene):

- Include the tall tree in the background, with visible branches and leaves.
- Maintain the snowy environment and clear blue sky.
- Introduce hints of rabbit tracks in the snow near Toby's position for the next scene.
