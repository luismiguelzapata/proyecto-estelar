ENVIRONMENT:
A serene winter forest scene, early afternoon, with a clear blue sky (#87CEEB) and a snowy landscape (#FFFFFF) covering the ground. The tall tree in the background remains a focal point, with its branches lightly dusted with snow. The dominant color palette includes whites, blues, and hints of peach-orange from the sunlight filtering through the branches.

CHARACTERS PRESENT:
Kira (smiling warmly), Toby (enthusiastic and nodding), Axolotl Médico (grateful and joyful).

ACTION & MOVEMENT:
The Axolotl Médico stands near the base of the tree, looking up at Kira and Toby with gratitude. Kira, back on the ground, turns to Toby and speaks with a warm smile. Toby nods in agreement, adding his own enthusiastic remark. The axolotl then clasps its hands together in a gesture of offering, which Kira and Toby politely decline with friendly gestures.

CAMERA:
Medium shot focusing on Kira and Toby from a slightly lower angle to emphasize their kind demeanor. The camera then pans slightly to include the Axolotl Médico, capturing the dynamic interaction among them.

LIGHTING & MOOD:
Soft studio lighting to enhance the warmth and kindness of the scene. The sunlight filters through the branches, creating a gentle peach-orange (#FFB380) glow that adds to the atmosphere of camaraderie and gratitude.

TECHNICAL:
3D CGI animation, Pixar/Disney quality, soft studio lighting, vibrant colors, 8K render, estimated duration of 5-8 seconds.

CONTINUITY NOTES (for next scene):
- Position Kira and Toby walking away from the axolotl, heading towards their home.
- Maintain the snowy forest setting with the snow-capped mountain becoming more prominent in the background.
- Keep the clear blue sky and the rabbit tracks in the snow as a visual link.
- Ensure the axolotl remains near the base of the tree, waving goodbye.
