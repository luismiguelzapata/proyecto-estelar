ILLUSTRATION 4 — "The Missing Signal"

ENVIRONMENT:
The scene is set in a serene, lush forest clearing during mid-morning, where soft, golden sunlight filters through the dense canopy of leaves, casting dappled shadows on the ground. The sky is a brilliant blue (#87CEEB), with wisps of white clouds drifting lazily. The ground is covered in a vibrant carpet of moss (#A8C686) and scattered leaves, creating a textured and inviting surface. Tall, majestic trees surround the clearing, their trunks a deep, rich brown (#8B4513) with rugged bark that adds depth and character to the scene. In the background, a gentle stream glistens under the sunlight, its clear water reflecting hues of blue and green. Delicate wildflowers in shades of lavender (#E6E6FA) and yellow (#FFD700) dot the landscape, adding bursts of color. A small wooden signpost stands off to one side, slightly weathered yet sturdy, hinting at well-trodden paths.

CHARACTERS PRESENT:
Kira and Toby are positioned slightly off-center, facing the axolotl médico, who stands opposite them. Kira, with her expressive eyes wide open, looks curious and attentive. Toby, with his usual contemplative demeanor, listens intently. The axolotl médico, slightly smaller, appears concerned, its hands clasped together. Each character is grounded in the scene, with their distinctive colors and accessories clearly visible.

LIGHTING & MOOD:
The lighting is warm and inviting, with soft rays of sunlight streaming down, creating a cozy and hopeful atmosphere. The ambient light enhances the natural colors, making the scene feel magical and alive. Shadows are soft and diffuse, providing depth without harsh contrasts.

COMPOSITION & STYLE:
The illustration follows the rule of thirds, with the characters and key elements distributed harmoniously across the frame. The depth is achieved by layering foreground foliage, midground characters, and a background of trees and flowing water. The style is a classic 3D CGI storybook, reminiscent of Pixar, with a rich, vibrant palette that includes shades of green, blue, and warm earth tones.

CONTINUITY NOTES (for next illustration):
Maintain the position of Kira and Toby in relation to the axolotl médico. The forest setting should remain consistent, with emphasis on the tall tree mentioned in the next paragraph. Keep the morning light and the overall serene mood.
