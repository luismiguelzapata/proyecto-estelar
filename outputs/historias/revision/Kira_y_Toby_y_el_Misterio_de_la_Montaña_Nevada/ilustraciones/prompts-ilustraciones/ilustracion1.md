ILLUSTRATION 1 — MOUNTAIN MORNING MYSTERY

ENVIRONMENT:
The scene is set on a snow-covered mountain during a bright morning. The sky is a clear and vibrant blue (#87CEEB) with the sun shining brightly, casting long, soft shadows across the snowy landscape. The snow is pristine and glistens under the sunlight, creating a sparkling effect that adds magic to the scene. The dominant color palette includes the pure white of the snow (#FFFFFF), the blue of the sky, and touches of golden sunlight (#FFD700) that bathes everything in a warm glow. In the foreground, snowdrifts create gentle mounds, while in the midground, a few sparse pine trees with dark green needles (#2E8B57) stand resilient against the cold. In the background, the mountain peaks rise majestically, covered in snow, with hints of rocky outcrops peeking through. Decorative details include small patches of exposed earth (#8B4513) near the base of the trees, and tiny icicles hanging from the branches, reflecting the sunlight like miniature chandeliers.

CHARACTERS PRESENT:
Kira stands to the left, her expression one of concern, ears perked up, with the red bow on her right ear contrasting against her golden fur. Toby is to the right, a reassuring expression on his face, slightly leaning towards Kira, his collar a deep navy blue against his dark fur. Both are positioned centrally, occupying the foreground, with the snowy mountain landscape behind them.

LIGHTING & MOOD:
The lighting is bright and natural, with the sunlight providing a warm, golden hue that contrasts beautifully with the cool tones of the snow and sky. The mood is a mix of curiosity and slight tension, highlighted by Kira's concerned look, but balanced by Toby's optimistic demeanor.

COMPOSITION & STYLE:
The composition follows the rule of thirds, with Kira and Toby placed towards the lower third, drawing attention to their expressions. The snowy mountain serves as a majestic backdrop, framing the scene. The style is 3D CGI storybook, Pixar quality, with a color palette featuring golds, blues, and whites that create a whimsical yet slightly mysterious atmosphere.

CONTINUITY NOTES (for next illustration):
Maintain Kira and Toby's positions and expressions. Keep the snowy mountain environment with the clear blue sky. Include consistent lighting and shadows to match the time of day.
