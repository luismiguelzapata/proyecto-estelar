ENVIRONMENT:
The setting is the serene lake shore at midday, under a clear blue sky. The sun is shining brightly, casting warm reflections on the water. The sandy shore is dotted with small pebbles, and lush green trees line the background. The dominant palette is a mix of soft blues, greens, and sandy browns.

CHARACTERS PRESENT:
Kira, in an excited state, with eyes wide open and ears perked up. Toby stands slightly behind, observing with curiosity.

ACTION & MOVEMENT:
Kira excitedly spots a shiny object, a silver scarf, on a nearby rock. She points with her paw while looking back at Toby, urging him to look. Toby, intrigued, leans forward slightly to get a better view. The camera captures Kira’s enthusiastic expression and Toby’s curious demeanor.

CAMERA:
Start with a medium shot focusing on Kira, then pan slightly to include Toby in the frame. Zoom in slowly on Kira's pointing paw, then transition to a close-up of the silver scarf glinting in the sunlight.

LIGHTING & MOOD:
The scene is brightly lit with natural sunlight, enhancing the vibrant colors of the environment. The mood is one of excitement and discovery, emphasized by the shimmering effect of the light on the scarf.

TECHNICAL:
3D CGI animation, Pixar/Disney quality, soft studio lighting, vibrant colors, 8K render, duration approximately 5-8 seconds.

CONTINUITY NOTES (for next scene):
- The silver scarf must remain on the rock, ready for interaction.
- Kira should maintain her position slightly ahead of Toby.
- Toby should be leaning forward, indicating interest.
- The lake shore, sandy ground, and trees in the background continue to be part of the environment.
- Prepare for the magical effect of stardust when the scarf is touched in the next scene.
