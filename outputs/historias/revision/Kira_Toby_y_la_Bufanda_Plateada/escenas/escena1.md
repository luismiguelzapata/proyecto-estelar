ENVIRONMENT:
The scene takes place at the tranquil shore of a sparkling lake on a sunny morning. The sky is a clear blue (#87CEEB), and the sunlight casts a warm glow over the landscape. The lake reflects the sky, creating a serene and inviting atmosphere. The shore is lined with soft, light brown sand and a few scattered pebbles. Lush green trees (#228B22) frame the background, adding depth to the scene.

CHARACTERS PRESENT:
Kira, the Shiba Inu, appears excited, with her pastel yellow fur (#FFF9D4) glistening in the sunlight. Her heart-shaped spot (#FFB380) is visible on her right cheek. Toby, the Husky, stands confidently beside her, his fur a soft lavender-gray (#E8E3F0). His heterochromatic eyes—left blue (#6BB6D6), right brown (#8B6F47)—gaze toward the horizon. The lightning bolt (#A8D8EA) on his left flank is subtly illuminated by the sunlight.

ACTION & MOVEMENT:
Kira playfully bounds along the shore, occasionally glancing back at Toby, who walks with a steady, confident stride. They both stop at the water's edge, looking out over the lake, their reflections shimmering in the gentle ripples of the water.

CAMERA:
The camera begins with a wide shot, capturing the beautiful expanse of the lake and the vibrant morning sky. It slowly zooms in on Kira and Toby, focusing on their expressions of excitement and confidence. The camera then pans slightly to follow Kira's playful movements.

LIGHTING & MOOD:
The scene is brightly lit with soft studio lighting, emphasizing the warmth and joy of the sunny morning. The mood is adventurous and uplifting, setting the tone for the upcoming journey.

TECHNICAL:
3D CGI animation, Pixar/Disney quality, soft studio lighting, vibrant colors, 8K render, estimated duration 5-8 seconds.

CONTINUITY NOTES (for next scene):
- Kira and Toby should remain at the lake shore.
- Kira's position should be slightly ahead of Toby, closer to the water.
- The environment must include the lake, sandy shore, and trees in the background.
- Ensure the lighting and vibrant colors remain consistent for the next scene.
- Prepare for the introduction of a shiny silver scarf on a rock.
