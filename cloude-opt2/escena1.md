SCENE 1 — A MORNING PLAYTIME

ENVIRONMENT:
A serene lakeside setting during a bright, sunny morning. The lake's water is calm and reflects the clear blue sky. Surrounding the lake are lush green grasses (#A8D08D) and a few scattered wildflowers in soft pastels. The color palette is vibrant, dominated by blues and greens, with warm touches from the sun. 

CHARACTERS PRESENT:
- Kira (dog): Energetic and excited, with her expressive eyes (#1E90FF) wide open.
- Toby (dog): Observant and thoughtful, with a slightly furrowed brow, reflecting deep thought.

ACTION & MOVEMENT:
Kira and Toby are playfully chasing each other around, their paws creating gentle ripples at the edge of the lake. Suddenly, a dark red object streaks across the sky, catching Kira's attention. She stops abruptly, looking up with amazement. Toby, noticing her pause, follows her gaze with a more analytical expression. Kira's tail wags energetically as she asks, "Did you see that?" Toby nods, his eyes narrowing slightly as he processes the sight.

CAMERA:
Begin with a wide shot capturing the entire lakeside scene, then smoothly pan to focus on Kira and Toby's playful interaction. Transition to a close-up of Kira's face when the object flies by, capturing her excitement. Finally, shift to a medium shot showing both dogs as they look across the lake.

LIGHTING & MOOD:
Soft studio lighting enhances the vibrant colors, with warm sunlight casting gentle, playful shadows. The mood is lighthearted and adventurous, setting a tone of curiosity and anticipation.

TECHNICAL:
3D CGI animation, Pixar/Disney quality, soft studio lighting, vibrant colors, 8K render. Estimated duration of 5-8 seconds.

CONTINUITY NOTES (for next scene):
- The dark red object that flew over must be visible in the background, having landed on the opposite side of the lake.
- Kira's red bow and Toby's navy blue collar should remain prominently visible.
- Ensure the bright, sunny atmosphere and the clear, reflective lake are consistent.
- Kira should maintain her excited demeanor, while Toby remains thoughtful.
